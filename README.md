# GraphQL QuickStart with Spring Boot, Kotlin and MongoDB

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
GraphQL offers the following features and advantages over traditional REST API's:
* Provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API
* Gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more
* Makes it easier to evolve APIs over time
* Enables powerful developer tools.

In this article, weâ€™ll see what is GraphQL, the benefits of using GraphQL by building a simple GraphQL server 
with Spring Boot and MongoDB, and its benefits over REST implementation.

## How GraphQL solves REST API drawbacks:

* GraphQL provides the flexibility to consumers to request for the attributes as needed (provides dynamic data in request). 
  The REST API response is always fixed, as it sends the entire JSON object for every request.
* REST API has over-fetching and under-fetching problems.
* Better performance with lesser code.
* GraphQL exposes a single endpoint for all the operations with Query and Mutation and its HTTP POST method. In REST, 
  every operation has a separate API using different HTTP verbs(GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) as per the requirement.
* GraphQL depends on Schema file defined for the application. Only Properties or operations specified on 
  Schema file will be exposed to consumers.

## Query Type:

Query type is a root type in GraphQL schema used to create a query to fetch the data from GraphQL server. 
It's commonly used to define read-only (GET) operations.

## Mutation Type:

Mutation type is another root type in GraphQL schema, used to define operations to manipulate data (POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Object Type:

Object type is used to define user-defined types (class in Java/Kotlin) with properties and data types used as an
input/output parameter to perform operations with Query and Mutation types as defined in schema file.

## GraphQL Resolvers:

A resolver is a function that's responsible for populating the data for a single field in your schema. 
It can populate that data in any way you define, such as by fetching data from a back-end database or a third-party API.
